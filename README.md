-	Analyzed and visualized individual and aggregated customer consumption data to identify grid inefficiencies such as charging electric vehicles during periods of peak demand.  Goal of identifying and changing behavior.

- Assessed if wind direction and velocity caused a correlated shift to predicted tide levels in Wells, ME using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.
   - Extracted data using API and by segmenting requests to avoid limitations.
   - Plotted data with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
   - Determined ENE and E wind directions have a positive coorelation with respect to predicted height.  A 20 mph sustained wind will cause about a 2 ft increase in sea level.

- Evaluated the efficiency of the of each fire station in the San Francisco Fire Department.
- Created a visually compelling story by assessing response times of each station from original dataset of over 550k records.

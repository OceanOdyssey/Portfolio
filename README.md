## Portfolio

#### Ipswich Electric Light Department (Python - Add link)
-	Analyzed and visualized individual and aggregated customer consumption data to identify grid inefficiencies such as charging electric vehicles during periods of peak demand.  Goal of identifying and changing behavior.


#### NOAA Tidal Prediction Shift Based on Wind Speed and Direction (Python - Link)
- Assessed if wind direction and velocity caused a correlated shift to predicted tide levels in Wells, ME using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.  Extracted data using API by segmenting requests to avoid limitations.


#### San Francisco Fire Department Assessment (Tableau - Link)
- I evaluated the efficiency of the of each fire station in the San Francisco Fire Department.  Created a visually compelling story by assessing response times of each station from original dataset of over 550k records.

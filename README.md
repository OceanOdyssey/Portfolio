- Analyzed and visualized individual and aggregated customer consumption data to identify grid inefficiencies such as charging electric vehicles during periods of peak demand.
- Data was extracted from individual files and put into a Pandas DataFrame.  Statistics for 3 criteria were collected to determine how likely each house had an electric vehicle.
- Goal of identifying and changing behavior.

- Assessed if wind direction and velocity caused a correlated shift to predicted tide levels in Wells, ME using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.
- Extracted data using API and by segmenting requests to avoid limitations.
- Plotted data with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Determined ENE and E wind directions have a positive correlation with respect to predicted height.  A 20 mph sustained wind from the ENE or E will cause about a 2 ft increase in sea level.

- Evaluated the efficiency of each fire station in the San Francisco Fire Department.
- Created a visually compelling Tableau story by assessing response times of each station from original dataset of over 550k records.

  - Assessed if wind direction and velocity caused a correlated shift to predicted tide levels in Wells, ME using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.  Extracted data using API by segmenting requests to avoid limitations.

### Tableau
  #### San Francisco Fire Department Assessment
  [Link on Tableu Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/chrisg#!/vizhome/SanFranciscoFireDepartmentAssessment/SanFranciscoFireDepartmentAssessment)
  - I evaluated the efficiency of the of each fire station in the San Francisco Fire Department.  Created a visually compelling story by assessing response times of each station from original dataset of over 550k records.
